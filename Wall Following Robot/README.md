# Wall Following Robot
## Description
Designed an autonomous robot car which follows along a path defined between two walls. The robot car uses a pair of infrared (IR) sensors to detect its distance relative to the walls. The robot car then adjusts the speed of its motors via pulse width modulation (PWM) proportionally to the distances from the wall in order to avoid bumping/hitting the walls as it transverses the path.
