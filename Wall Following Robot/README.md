# Wall Following Robot
## Description
Designed an autonomous robot car which follows along a path defined between two walls. The robot car tries to maintain itself inbetween the two walls and as close as possible towards the center. The robot car uses a pair of infrared (IR) sensors to gauge its distance relative to the walls. The IR sensors' readings are converted from analog to digital using one of the four internal ADC sequencer of the microcontroller to compute the distance. The robot car then adjusts the speed of its motors via pulse width modulation (PWM) proportionally to the information received from the distances from the wall in order to avoid bumping/hitting the walls as it transverses the path. An LCD display is attached to the top of the robot which shows the distance from the walls in both direction and the current duty cycle of the PWM for both wheels.
